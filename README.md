- 👋 Hi, I’m @jellypuff
- 👀 I’m interested in food, gaming, reading, writing, art and other nerdy pursuits.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git (huhu), HTML, CSS an Javascript. My formal background is in statistics though. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on streams, blogging and more (just ask, I don't bite unless you're tasty).
- 📫 How to reach me: jellypuffplays@gmail.com

And last, but not least, if you want to treat me to a little:
